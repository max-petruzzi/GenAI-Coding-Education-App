# Generative-AI-enabled Mobile App for Coding Education

This was the 1st place-winning project in the 2023 McKinsey Digital Hackathon. In collaboration with Code.org, the goal of this work was to help bring coding education to developing countries.

### Background:  
With the proliferation of mobile devices and LTE coverage worldwide, mobile applications are a more accessible option for reaching students in developing countries. However, because of the lack of keyboard and limited integrated development environments (IDEs), mobile devices are a challenging medium for delivering software for coding education. As one of four non-governmental organizations (NGOs) part of the 2023 McKinsey Digital Hackathon, Code.org brought this challenge to our team to be completed in a packed 24 hours.

### Solution:  

Our team built a mobile application that gives students and teachers real-time feedback on their verbal explanations of coding concepts. Through the power of the OpenAI and YouTube APIs, our mobile platform generates and analyzes a transcript of submitted videos for accuracy and comprehensiveness. Through the app, teachers can create assignments and view student submissions along with aggregated metrics to assess student understanding and identify common points of confusion. Because teachers in developing countries often come from different subject areas before teaching coding, our platform also allows teachers to receive feedback on their explanations of concepts.

### Contents:  
In this repository, you will find the code submitted for this project as well as additional materials from the hackathon. These include our presentation to McKinsey and Code.org senior leadership, screen recordings of the app from our live demo, an example student video submission, and photos from the event. Thank you for your interest in our project.
